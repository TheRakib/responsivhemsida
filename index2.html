               <h2>  Youtubability </h2>
                <p>A key driver of youtubability is the <strong> clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.</p>
       
                <p> Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting the <strong> lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
                games.</p>

                <p> Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
                <p>For instance, ask yourself if a user’s
                inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the
                <strong> objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong>to play?</strong>  Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
                 seconds (too long!).</p>
                <p>Make sure to <strong>use colours </strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
                Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>

           <p> if you want to run user tests with
            friends and family or even random
            people in the street, it is interesting to
            show them the 30 second video before
            making them try to prototype in order
            to
           <strong> understand their </strong>
            expectations f rom
            the video vs. the actual game they </p>
             <p>try.
            <strong>Make it obvious</strong>
            with visual elements
            that help
           <strong> understand the objective and
            controls </strong>
            of the game, like with the
            target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s
            Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw
            Car with the space dedicated to
            drawing.

           <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games
           <strong> on their </strong>
            phone’s Facebook feed
            , everything will seem smaller than when
            displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
           <strong> You should
            also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if
            someone watches it
            on a small screen. </strong>
            With an average watch time of 3
            to 5 seconds, this is an
           <strong> accelerated elevator pitch! </strong> 
           </p>

           <p> Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on
            YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea
            for your game videos.
